👨‍💻 About Me

I am an Embedded Software Engineer currently working at FPT Telecom. My core focus lies in developing high-performance, low-latency communication systems and optimizing video delivery for IoT ecosystems. I have a strong interest in event-driven architectures and Linux system programming.

🔭 Currently at: FPT Telecom (Developing IoT Gateways & Cloud Camera Solutions).

👯 Collaborating on: Ak-Embedded-Software - A robust ecosystem for event-driven embedded systems.

💬 Ask me about: C/C++, Linux Kernel, WebRTC, Media Streaming protocols.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy deep-diving into memory management and optimizing code down to the bit level.

🛠 Technical Expertise

🟦 Advanced C/C++ Development

Modern C++ (11/14/17): Proficient in utilizing Smart Pointers, RAII, and Template Metaprogramming to build safe, scalable Linux-based applications.

Embedded C: Extensive experience in HAL/Driver development (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN) for ARM Cortex-M and MIPS architectures.

Software Architecture: Skilled in Event-driven architecture, State Machines, and Multi-threading synchronization.

🌐 WebRTC & Real-time Communication

P2P Networking: Implementing ultra-low latency (< 200ms) video/audio streaming solutions.

Connectivity: Expertise in NAT Traversal using STUN/TURN/ICE and managing signaling flows.

Protocol Stack: Deep understanding of DTLS/SRTP for secure transmission and SCTP for reliable DataChannels.

🎥 Media Streaming & Processing

GStreamer: Designing complex multimedia pipelines with hardware acceleration (OpenMAX, VA-API, RKMPP).

Video Compression: In-depth knowledge of H.264/H.265 (HEVC) encoding, bitrate control (CBR/VBR), and frame-type optimization.

FFmpeg Integration: Leveraging libav libraries for custom transcoding and edge-device recording solutions.
